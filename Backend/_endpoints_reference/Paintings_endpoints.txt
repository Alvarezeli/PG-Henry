        "description": " a wry commentary on the bravura of midcentury Abstract Expressionism. Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. ",

    "description": "In Woman III Lichtenstein injected both humor and a Pop Art chill into the older painter’s wriggling swaths and slashes of bold color while playing directly on de Kooning’s series of confrontational “Woman” paintings. The fierce figure is denoted by two eyes, an elfin ear, nose, lips, bared teeth, and a patch of red dots that stand in for a rouged cheek.",

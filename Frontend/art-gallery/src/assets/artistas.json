      "biography": "Jean-Marc Janiaczyk was born in 1966 in Douai, in the north of France, he is a self-taught landscape painter who painted exclusively oil paintings and in 1990 he started with a technically demanding style, hyper-realism. In 1998 he began to use a spatula and devoted himself above all to landscapes of Provence, with their vibrant and intense colours. In his paintings he has faithfully portrayed the light and heat of the region's summer. Bright red poppies, orange sunflowers, fields, modest houses on the side of the road receding into the distance... in the author's landscapes one can see some similarities with the works of his teacher and inspirer, V. Van Gogh. He exhibited his works in Florida, France, Denmark, Germany, Spain and Morocco and his paintings are in many private collections in France, Belgium, USA, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Czech Republic and Morocco.",

          "description": "Lavender is an essential plant of Provence, it is cultivated and distilled to obtain an oil, to be used mainly in cosmetics and perfumes. Under the sun's rays, lavender welcomes you by releasing its fragrance. Lavender fields are fascinating because of these colors that change depending on the light of day, blue, violet, pink, and even orange tones in the light of sunset.",

In Kiel I own two dance schools and my artwork is inspired by my passion for dancing, merging the charm and grace of a dancer, thus giving the paintings a very special, very sensual touch. Furthermore, through years of experience with body control, as well as the insight of an expert in body language, which I acquired in the long years as a trainer, choreographer and dancer, I bring my paintings to life in a very artistic way. When I finish a painting, I am ready for it to find its new home. I've had my time creating and developing, and when it's over, my time with it is over and I know it was created for someone else's enjoyment. I love what I do. I love creating works of art and I am proud of the images I create. Beautiful and meaningful images that speak to people as much as they spoke to me.",

I've looked back at my old art and realized that years ago I tended to draw people in huddled positions with their backs to the world, I think unconsciously it was an expression of my vulnerability, insecurity, fear... While that I now feel so at ease and capable, a sense of being one with my own being that I have never experienced before. A kind of healing that feels like landing back in my own body after not being fully there for for as long as I can remember... The way I no longer feel suffocated and terrified is really unreal.",
